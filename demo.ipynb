            "1.  **Task Design:** The study proposed an \"affected hand movement versus rest\" motor imagery paradigm as an alternative to the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery. This approach aimed to simplify the task and address the weak contralateral activation often observed in stroke patients.\n",
            "    *   **Experimental Evidence:** The experimental results demonstrated that the \"MI vs. rest\" approach generally showed better classification performance compared to the \"left vs. right\" approach. Specifically, the MI vs. rest condition exhibited superior classification performance. Paired sample t-tests confirmed that the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for both L:Rest and R:Rest compared to L:R. EEGNet showed significant improvements in both healthy and stroke patient groups, while FBCSP was significant in all conditions except R:Rest in the healthy group. These findings indicate that this proposed task design enhances MI classification in stroke patients.\n",

            "2.  **Training Protocol (Session Duration):** The study investigated the impact of session duration on BCI performance.\n",
            "    *   **Experimental Evidence:** The findings revealed that shorter training sessions produced better BCI performance than longer sessions. Furthermore, the research suggested that using data from multiple short training sessions or implementing adaptive training protocols could further enhance MI classification performance compared to using the entire dataset at once or single, longer sessions.\n",
